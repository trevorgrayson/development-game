# development

This starts with a single commit, and is the worst hello world game ever.
But if you can program, or you can hack it, you can make it a little bit better.

The game itself isn't important, but you being able to increment on it and 
contribute back to the codebase is.  The most important thing is to make it
as fun as possible, for the most people, if you want it to be.

Good luck.

## A web server exists...

It represents me. Every time a request is made to it, I get a point. Is this fair?
I don't know, but it seems like I should win at this point.  My advantage.

It isn't necessarily in your benefit to be a good programmer.  It's more important
that you can convince people that altering the game in your way is the best way.
Or maybe you can get away changing it without their permission.

Your turn.
