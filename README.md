# development

Welcome to `The Game.`

It starts with a single commit; the worst hello world game ever.
But if you can program, or you can hack it, you can make it a little bit better.

The game itself isn't important at this point, but it should be fun.
You being able to increment on it and contribute back to the codebase is
something to do for its own sake.  Make it as fun as possible, for the most people, 
if you want it to be.

Good luck.

## Check the Makefile.

If you're a developer, you have `make` installed already, even if you don't know it.

Run the game by typing `make play` or `make`.

Commit to save progress.
