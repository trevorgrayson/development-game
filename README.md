Welcome to `The Game.`

It starts with a single commit; the worst hello world game ever.
But if you can program, or you can hack it, you can make it a little bit better.

The game itself isn't important at this point, but it should be fun.
You being able to increment on it and contribute back to the codebase is
something to do for its own sake.  Make it as fun as possible, for the most people, 
if you want it to be.

Good luck.

## To play without code

It is the intent of this developer to make this game accessible to people over as many
protocols as is humorous.   

### terminal

To truly be a live player, you need to be able to make connections to The Game with
a terminal.  Download your favorite, any should do.

Recommended Terminal Apps:

* Terminus - OSX, free download. 

```
telnet localhost 1337
```


## Check the Makefile.

If you're a developer, you have `make` installed already, even if you don't know it.

Run the game by typing `make play` or `make`.

Commit to save progress.
